This is a number game where a random number is generated using rand function and we need to guess the number. Every time we select a number higher than the given, it will show that the guess is too high and same for lower guesses.
The live demonstration of the project can be seen in the following link - https://aditya-dhoble.github.io/Projects/number%20game/
