## Welcome to MY First Project

It is a basic frontend project where I have written my application for website operations team at IIT Madras. 
I have created a form validator which can sense whether the typed parameters like email and mobile numbers are valid (Note: The mobile number section only checks the validity as per the Indian format. I would like to enhance it to read for global formats in near future).It includes a basic loading animation as well. It is a static website and does not have any backend to it.
